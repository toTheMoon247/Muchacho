Inviting aromas of morello cherries and dried herbs lead to a palate layered with forest fruits, earth and a gentle lift of wood spice. Thirty-six months in old French oak tonneaux has added further complexity to the wine, rounding out the fine, supple tannins on the finish. This is classically styled Brunello of purity and finesse.

This is full of ¬fine raspberry and blackberry fruit; a beautiful freshness mingling with sweet sophistication.

The ¬finish is long and moreish, with a slightly drier sensation than other Houses, making it a particularly fabulous match with a cheese course. The beauty of this LBV is that it is not overly rich and, by contrast, is fresh on its toes, encouraging (at least) another sip.")
